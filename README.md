# **MATH F313**: Numerical Analysis

some practice codes written for Numerical Analysis course in college. 

**multi_newton.py** here is an interesting one, which uses the **sympy** library to solve for voltages in some complicated circuit (Exercise from Mark Newman's book on Computational Physics).
This is done using a *multiple variable version of the newton method* for finding roots.

The other codes are simpler root finding methods for single variable functions and there's one code which implements the LU-Decomposition on matrices.
